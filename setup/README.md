## Setup

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/labs` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/labs
```

Clone the [Intro to SQL Lab Starter Code](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/intro-to-sql-lab-starter-code) repository, and enter the new directory:

```bash
git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/intro-to-sql-lab-starter-code.git
cd intro-to-sql-lab-starter-code
```


Once cloned, you'll need to remove the existing `.git` information.

This can be done with the following command:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

> Removing the `.git` info is important as this is just a starter code provided by GA. You do not need the existing git history for this project.

With the old `.git` information removed, you can now reinitialize Git to start your own version control history.

Use these commands to initialize a new Git repository and make your first commit:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Next, open the contents of your new project directory in VSCode:

```bash
code .
```

Create a new database called `world` and populate it with the SQL found in `world.sql`:

```bash
psql -f world.sql
```

Start `psql` and connect to the new database called `world`:

```bash
psql -d world
```

Use the `\d` command to see what tables are available. You should see:

| Schema | Name             | Type  | Owner         |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----- | ------------- |
| public | cities           | table | your-username |
| public | countries        | table | your-username |
| public | countrylanguages | table | your-username |

Now that you are connected to `psql` and see your tables, you're ready to start.
